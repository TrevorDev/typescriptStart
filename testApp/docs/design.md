Why make this:
So i know excatly what is happening up until the browser
For fun, it is relaxing to make

Coordinate system:
+y is up
+x is right
-z is forward
This mirrors threeJS/opengl defaults, will make gltf easier to import because it uses the same.
This is also the reason why an initial object.forward is (0,0,-1) which is weird but whatever
